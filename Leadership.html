Dr. Arthur B. Powell is Professor in the Department of Urban Education at Rutgers-Newark. He is currently working on two projects. The first is called, "Executive Functions + Mathematics." He is working with middle-school teachers and students in Newark, NJ and Vista, CA. The aim of this project is to provide opportunities for online collaboration through a portal (Virtual Math Team developed by Drexel University), and to engage in problem solving tasks that will engage students in three different topic areas: proportional reasoning, algebra & geometry - in order to help them attain greater identification with Mathematics and help them work collaboratively on problem solving tasks. Currently, the project is are providing online professional development to teachers.
<br><br>
The second is a theoretical project on differences between different historical and philosophical approaches to rational numbers and its implications for youth. Overall, Dr. Powell's research interests focus on writing and mathematics learning; ethnomathematics; development of mathematical ideas, reasoning, and heuristics; teacher professional development in teaching mathematics; and collaborative problem solving in mathematics with technology.  He also directs the Research Group on Communication, Technology, and Mathematics Learning and its instructional project, eMath.
