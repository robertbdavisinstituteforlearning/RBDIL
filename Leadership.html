Carolyn A. Maher has focused her
research and scholarship on students' mathematical reasoning and argumentation,
supported by the National Science Foundation and other sources, in excess of
$16 million. Professor Maher is known internationally for her multi-year
longitudinal studies of students' mathematical learning and student reasoning.
She received the 2022 National Council Teachers of Mathematics Lifetime
Achievement Award. She has served as Director of the Robert B. Davis
Institute for Learning at Rutgers University for over three decades and as
the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Mathematical Behavior for two decades.
Professor Maher holds a B.A. in Mathematics, and an Ed.D. in Mathematics
Education, from Rutgers University.<br><br>

Dr. Arthur B. Powell is currently working on two projects. The first is
called, "Executive Functions + Mathematics." He is working with middle-school
teachers and students in Newark, NJ and Vista, CA. The aim of this project
is to provide opportunities for online collaboration through a portal
(Virtual Math Team developed by Drexel University), and for students to
engage in problem solving tasks that will engage them in three different topic
areas - proportional reasoning, algebra, and geometry. The aim is to help them
attain greater identification with mathematics and help them work
collaboratively on problem solving tasks. Currently, the project is
providing online professional development to teachers.
<br><br>
The second is a theoretical project on differences between diverse
historical and philosophical approaches to rational numbers and their
implications for youths studying mathematics.
<br><br>
Overall, Dr. Powell's research interests focus
on writing and mathematics learning; ethnomathematics; development of
mathematical ideas, reasoning, and heuristics; teacher professional
development in teaching mathematics; and collaborative problem solving in
mathematics with technology.  He also directs the Research Group on
Communication, Technology, and Mathematics Learning and its instructional
project, eMath.
