<p align="justify">
Dr. Marjory F. Palius is a senior researcher at the RBDIL, continuing her
collaborative relationship with the institute's personnel and projects
after sixteen years of serving as its associate director (2008-2016) and
assistant director (2000-2008). Marjory has also taught for the GSE as
an adjunct instructor and as an assistant professor of professional practice
(2014-2016) in the Department of Learning and Teaching. She has mentored
many students, informally as well as through academic appointments.
Her career pathway has also included stints of working as a middle-school
teacher of mathematics at a charter school and conducting studies and
program evaluations in the field of workforce development. Marjory is a
talented innovator who co-led the team that built the Video Mosaic
Collaborative and conducted design research on its use in teacher education,
and she continues to support use of those materials in research and teacher
education. Marjory's research interests are diverse and transdisciplinary,
mostly focused on the learning sciences yet extending to broader issues,
such as the convergence of teacher education programs with workforce
development and public policy initiatives.
<br><br>
Marjory earned a bachelor's
degree in sociology from Smith College with a minor in linguistics and
philosophy of language. She has two degrees in education: a masters in
social and philosophical foundations and a doctorate in learning and
