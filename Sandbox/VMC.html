   Goals and the Video Mosaic Collaborative (VMC)
</h2>

<p align="justify">

Learning mathematics is a complex process that requires many theoretical lenses, 
including those of mathematics education researchers, mathematicians, discourse 
analysts, child developmental psychologists, learning scientists, and other scholars. 
A fundamental goal of the work of the Robert B. Davis Institute for Learning (RBDIL) 
is to advance the growth of knowledge about how individuals build mathematical 
understanding. A primary commitment of the Robert B. Davis Institute of Learning 
has been to develop and implement strategies to build interdisciplinary communities, 
some of which encourage access to users of the RBDIL video collections of mathematical 
teaching and learning, This collection is a subset (about 400 hours) which is stored 
in the Rutgers University Repository, Video Mosaic Collaborative (VMC), and available, 
open source, worldwide 
<a href="http://www.videomosaic.org/"><i>(Video Mosaic Collaborative)</i></a>. 
The Video Mosaic Collaborative (VMC) was 
built with an associated new tool (RUanalytic), which enables a user to create a 
video narrative (VMCAnalytic) and publish it on the VMC. These video narratives can be 
used for research and instruction and they can be linked to associated scholarly work. 
The full collection of 
over 4500 hours of digitized videos make up the RBDIL library. The digital collection
was made possible 
through longitudinal and cross-sectional research studies with a long history of 
support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Neuberger Foundation.  
Recent NSF funding enabled the building of new search tools. Dissemination was 
extended to communities of Language, Mathematics, Literacy, and Psychology research through 
presentations at scholarly conferences and publications, including books and journals, 
as well as published VMCAnalytics. During the last three years, with funding from the 
NSF to Build Community and Capacity (BCC),  there have been 37,281 videomosaic.org 
page views; 104,588, views/downloads of VMC content in the repository; 60 published 
VMCAnalytics; and 175 registered VMC users of the RUanalytic tool. These data exclude 
Rutgers University accounts. The VMC is open source, and it is available worldwide. 
The top ten countries accessing the VMC at present are: US, UK, Brazil, China, 
Canada, Australia, India, South Africa, Germany, and Italy. The ongoing work 
with the RBDIL video collection is dynamic, and it offers new opportunities for 
collaborations, within and outside the GSE. It is anticipated that continued support 
for this work will be forthcoming with expanded opportunities for further 
collaboration and building of community.

<h2 class="red" align="center">Video Collection</h2> 

<p align="justify"><i>The Robert B. Davis Institute for Learning</i> has built a
a unique video collection through research over a period spanning three decades about how 
children develop mathematical ideas and ways of reasoning.  With funding from multiple 
grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation, studies were conducted in a variety 
of settings and locations in New Jersey. The collection features the seminal 
Rutgers-Kenilworth longitudinal study, which followed the same cohort of children 
from first grade through high school and beyond.  Also featured is a year-long study 
based in a 4th grade classroom that focuses on children learning about fractions and 
rational numbers before any formal instruction per the school's curriculum at the time. 
The collection also features children from urban schools, with both classroom and 
after-school settings, including the Informal Math Learning study conducted over 
two and a half years with two cohorts of students and a cadre of teachers as participants 
in the research. In sum, there are over 4,500 hours of video in the collection.  
Mathematical content includes strands of counting-combinatorics, early algebra, 
fractions, probability, and pre-calculus. Our current work, 
<a href="http://www.videomosaic.org/"><i>Video Mosaic Collaborative</i></a>, is aimed 
at preserving this unique collection and making it accessible broadly to researchers, 
teacher educators, and teachers. </p>
