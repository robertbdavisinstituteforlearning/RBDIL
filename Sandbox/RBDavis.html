Robert B. Davis was born in Fall River, Massachusetts, a son of the late
Benjamin Franklin Davis and the late Ethel (Reed) Davis. He received his
doctorate in mathematics at MIT in 1951. Early in his career, as a faculty
member at Syracuse, Bob founded and led the Madison Project, an innovative
school mathematics program, based on children's thinking and strong teacher
participation. The Madison Project's materials, as well as its ways of
working, have had decisive influence on the profession as a whole.
Named after the innercity school in Syracuse where the work began, the
project helped to pioneer a pedagogy which emphasized careful and attentive
response to how students thought about the mathematics they explored.
It soon had impact nationwide, and then beyond.

The theme of helping disadvantaged children threads through Bob's whole life.
So does careful thinking about learning and cognition, investigated through
beautiful and seminal case studies. As we read these, even decades later,
we can hear the voices of the children whom he cared so much about. As
Director of the Madison Project, Davis would lead up to ten weeklong seminars
each summer, teaching between 100 and 1000 teachers each week in cities from
New York to Chicago to San Francisco. The methods and materials developed by
the project were designed, and later demonstrated to be successful, for children
from all walks of life. These materials, and others based on them, are still in
use throughout the world.

Bob worked at Syracuse University, at Webster College in Missouri, and at
the Center for Research in Education at Cornell before moving to the University
of Illinois in 1972. There he was Professor of Education, Associate Director of
the computer-based Education Research Laboratory, and Director of the Curriculum
Laboratory. At Illinois he continued his fundamental work on mathematical
cognition, especially through a series of important studies of learners'
mathematical thinking and problem solving. This theoretical orientation,
based on key ideas of cognitive science, informs his later work.
</p>
<p align="justify">
He also served on the Research Advisory Cominittee for the National Council
of Teachers of Mathematics, as a member of many National Science Foundation
Advisory Committees, including the NSF continuing panel on the Educational
Uses of Computers, as an advisor on mathematics programming to Children's
Television Workshop, and as advisor to many state education departments.
<p>
<p align="justify">
In 1971, together with Herb Ginsburg, Bob founded the Journal of Children's
Mathematical Behavior, which he edited until his death in 1997. The first
issue described its unique focus, on what mathematical thought means with
children, how it develops, and how one might attempt to study it. The second
word in the Journal's title soon seemed too restrictive, and eventually was
dropped. The Journal soon became, and has remained, an important sounding
board for new ideas in mathematics education.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Bob's work helped to define the field of mathematics education, and his
insight opened new ways of thinking about how people learn and do important
mathematics. From the start, Bob's focus was on people: how they thought,
what they did, how they learned from their experience, and most
especially -recorded with precision, analyzed with knowing, sympathetic care -
how they expressed themselves and their ideas. Bob taught, in fact, the way
he did research: mainly by listening. As he listened, both he and those who
spoke with him would change.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Bob's book, Learning Mathematics: the Cognitive Science Approach, which
appeared in 1984, laid out a new agenda for research in mathematics education.
This agenda, elaborated in the JMB, in part through papers of his own, in
part through editorials on other people's work, continues to unfold. The
resulting ferment of perspectives and ideas was heightened by Bob's move,
in 1988, to Rutgers. His later work took place within what had now become
a wide discussion among collaborating teachers, research scholars, and
educational activists, sparked by his continued research on the development
of mathematical ideas in children and adults. The communities that evolved
around his work found voices, listened, and responded to each other.
