<h1>Community Engagement</h1>
<p align="justify">
The RBDIL has a long history of community engagement based on partnerships
and projects implemented with public and charter schools over many decades
(1980s - 2020s). This work has included both long-term research partnerships
and shorter-term professional development programs, although sometimes
the latter type of work entailed a multi-year initiative with the school
partner, and what began as professional development subsequently became
research. That was the case for the Kenilworth Longitudinal Study, as well
as the cross-sectional research that engaged school partners in New Brunswick
and Colts Neck, all of which began with RBDIL providing supports for
elementary teachers in giving their students mathematics lessons.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Levels of community engagement waxed and waned with the availability of
funding sources for such work. Nationally and in New Jersey, there was
far more funding for educator professional development in the 1990s and
early 2000s than was made available from about 2006 onward. Sponsored
projects through which the RBDIL engaged the K-12 educator community
included the operation of a Regional Center for the New Jersey Statewide
Systemic Initia3ve from 1992-2001 in which workshops and other training
 were delivered to improve the quality of teaching in math and science
and incorporate technology into classroom instruction.
</p>

<p align="justify">
A longer and more focused partnership engaged school communities in the
three urban districts of New Brunswick, Perth Amboy, and Plainfield over
a period of eight years (1998-2006) through three rounds of funding cycles
for teacher professional development in the content areas of language
arts/literacy, mathematics, and science. Outcomes of that work included
participating teachers pursuing graduate studies and earning master's
degrees at the GSE. The enduring partnership with Plainfield Public Schools
led to obtaining a two large NSF research grants, Research on Informal
Math Learning (IML) and the MetroMath Center (with CMSCE and RU-N).

<b>Community Building with New Jersey Schools</b>
<br>
<p align="justify">
RBDIL, since its inception, has been committed to engaging in partnerships
with New Jersey schools. The work involves teacher professional development
and research studies, following teacher and student learning over time.
