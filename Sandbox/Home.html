<h2 class="red" align="center">Robert B. Davis Institute for Learning </h2>
<p align="justify">
The Robert B. Davis Institute for Learning (RBDIL) at Rutgers University's
Graduate School of Education
has worked with a
variety of partners over extended periods of time to create conditions
for learning environments that optimize students' understanding of the
mathematics they are learning. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
RBDIL has a successful history of long-term commitments to education reform
initiatives and works closely with schools and districts, K-12.
Presentations and workshops for groups of teachers, math educators,
and administrators have been conducted throughout the United States as
well as in diverse settings in over 171 countries including Australia,
Brazil, Canada, Israel, South Africa, Mozambique, Japan, and China.
The Institute houses an extensive digitized video collection from three
decades of research on mathematics learning, reasoning, argumentation
and proof making in learners. The unique collection of over 4000 hours of
videos with accompanying metadata from longitudinal and cross-sectional
studies is stored in the cloud and available on the VMC to create video
narratives (VMCAnalytics). The Rutgers-Kenilworth longitudinal study
followed a cohort of students from grade 1 through grade 12, and through
college and beyond. Strands of tasks, student work and other metadata
can be viewed in the
<a href="https://videomosaic.org" target="_blank">Video Mosaic Collaborative</a>.
The video collection on the VMC is available worldwide, open source.
Over 100 video narratives are published and available as resources for
learning and teaching.

Carolyn A. Maher, Distinguished Professor of Mathematics Education and
the Director of the Institute, working with a small staff and a growing
network of Research Associates, has been a national leader in the field.
Dr. Maher's team has established a successful track record in conducting
collaborative research and teacher development projects, increasing 
knowledge in the field and bringing it into the classroom. At the heart
of the Davis Institute approach is the idea that a focus on deep
understanding in mathematical problem solving is the key to increasing
mathematics achievement. Research has shown that children have powerful
mathematical ideas and ways of reasoning that develop over time.
