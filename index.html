<p align="justify">
The Robert B. Davis Institute for Learning (RBDIL) at Rutgers University's
Graduate School of Education has worked with a variety of partners over
extended periods of time to create conditions for learning environments
that optimize students' understanding of the mathematics they are learning.
RBDIL has a successful history of long-term commitments to education reform
initiatives and works closely with schools and districts, K-12.

Presentations and workshops for groups of teachers, math educators, and administrators have been conducted throughout the United States as well as in diverse settings in over 171 countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel, South Africa, Mozambique, Japan, and China.<br><br>
The Institute houses an extensive digitized video collection from three decades of research on mathematics learning, reasoning, argumentation and proof making in learners. The unique collection of over 4000 hours of videos with accompanying metadata from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies is stored in the cloud and available on the VMC to create video narratives (VMCAnalytics). The Rutgers-Kenilworth longitudinal study followed a cohort of students from grade 1 through grade 12, and through college and beyond. The Rutgers-Colts Neck Study followed a class of fourth-grade students justifying solutions to fraction problems as they worked collaboratively building solutions. The Rutgers-Plainfield Informal Mathematics Learning (IML) 3-yr study followed 2 cohorts of students working on tasks in the fraction, counting, probability strands and teacher participants working with the students. Tasks, student work and other metadata can be viewed in the
<a href="https://videomosaic.org/" target="_blank">
Video Mosaic Collaborative</a>.
The video collection on the VMC is available worldwide, open source. Over 100 video narratives from the research studies are published and available as resources for learning and teaching.
