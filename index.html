  <h1>Robert B. Davis Institute for Learning </h1>
  
      <p align="justify">
      The Robert B. Davis Institute for Learning (RBDIL) at Rutgers University's 
	  Graduate School of Education has worked with a variety of partners over extended 
	  periods of time to create conditions for learning environments that optimize 
	  students' understanding of the mathematics they are learning.
RBDIL has a successful history of long-term commitments to education reform 
initiatives and works closely with schools and districts, K-12. Presentations and 
workshops for groups of teachers, math educators, and administrators have been 
conducted throughout the United States as well as in diverse settings in over 171 
countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel, South Africa, Mozambique, Japan, 
and China. The Institute houses an extensive digitized video collection from three 
decades of research on mathematics learning, reasoning, argumentation and proof 
making in learners. The unique collection of over 4000 hours of videos with accompanying 
metadata from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies is stored in the cloud and 
available on the VMC to create video narratives (VMCAnalytics). The Rutgers-Kenilworth 
longitudinal study followed a cohort of students from grade 1 through grade 12, and 
through college and beyond. Strands of tasks, student work and other metadata can be 
viewed in the 
<a href="http://www.videomosaic.org/" target="_blank"><i>(Video Mosaic Collaborative)</i></a>. The video collection 
on the VMC is available worldwide, open source. Over 100 video narratives are published and 
available as resources for learning and teaching.

Carolyn A. Maher, Distinguished Professor of Mathematics Education and the Director of the 
Institute, working with a small staff and a growing network of Research Associates, has 
been a national leader in the field. Dr. Maher's team has established a successful track 
record in conducting collaborative research and teacher development projects, increasing 
knowledge in the field and bringing it into the classroom. At the heart of the Davis 
Institute approach is the idea that a focus on deep understanding in mathematical problem 
solving is the key to increasing mathematics achievement. Research has shown that 
children have powerful mathematical ideas and ways of reasoning that develop over time.
