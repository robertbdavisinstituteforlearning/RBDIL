<h1>RBDIL Vision and Goals</h1>
  
<p align="justify">
The Robert B. Davis Institute for Learning has worked with a variety of
partners over extended periods of time to create conditions for learning
environments that optimize students' understanding of the mathematics
they are learning. Carolyn A. Maher, Distinguished Professor of Mathematics
Education and the Director of the Institute, working with a small staff
and a growing network of Research Associates, has been a national leader
in the field. Maher's team has established a successful track record in
conducting collaborative research and teacher development projects,
increasing knowledge in the field and bringing it into the classroom.
<br><br>
At the heart of the Davis Institute approach is the idea that a focus on
deep understanding in mathematical problem solving is the key to increasing
mathematics achievement. Research has shown that children have powerful
mathematical ideas and ways of reasoning that develop over time.
The Davis Institute's unique video collection includes over 4,500 hours of
longitudinal and cross-sectional video data on children's learning and
reasoning. This video collection is unique. It can serve as an important
tool for teacher learning.
