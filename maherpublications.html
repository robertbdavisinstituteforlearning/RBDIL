        <h5>Graduate School of Education</h5>

        <h5>Director of the Robert B. Davis Institute for Learning</h5>

        <p>Carolyn A. Maher is Professor II of Mathematics Education and the Director of the Robert B. Davis Institute for Learning at the Graduate School of Education, Rutgers. She is Editor of the Journal of Mathematical Behavior and has served on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Research in Mathematics Education. Her research, consisting of both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, has focused on the development of mathematical ideas and mathematical reasoning in learners over time. Most noteworthy is the longitudinal study that followed the mathematical thinking of a cohort group of students doing mathematics in and out of classrooms, now in its 21st year and tracking the subjects as young professionals. This longitudinal study is featured in the Private Universe Project in Mathematics, a series of six video workshops for teacher professional development that was produced by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The documentary, Surprises in Mind, published by RiverRun Media, features her long-term study. Recent research includes a three-year study of middle school students' informal mathematics learning in an after-school setting in an urban NJ school district. With the current Discovery Research K-12 grant from National Science Foundation, Maher and colleagues are now focusing on teacher education and how studying video episodes of children's learning from prior research potentially can improve teachers' abilities to reason mathematically. This latest NSF research project builds upon her current REESE Synthesis grant that selected video episodes on children's mathematical reasoning as representative samples from prior studies for inclusion in a prototype of a searchable database accessible via the Internet. Professor Maher has published over 60 refereed journal articles and book chapters, and has given over 30 invited lectures, plenary sessions, and keynote addresses. She was invited co-chair of the Topic Study Group for "New Trends in Mathematics Education Research" at the Eleventh International Congress on Mathematics Education, held in July 2008. She gave the invited keynote lecture Critical Thinking Skills in Schools and Museums at the Smithsonian Center for Education and Museum Studies in June 2007. She was a plenary speaker at the 26th PME in Norwich, England, 2002, Senior Lecturer at the International Congress for Mathematics Education in Copenhagen, Denmark, 2004, and Plenary Speaker at the University of Helsinki Conference in Finland, 2004.</p>
